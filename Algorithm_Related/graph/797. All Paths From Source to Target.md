Given a directed acyclic graph (**DAG**) of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, find all possible paths from node `0` to node `n - 1` and return them in **any order**.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[i]` is a list of all nodes you can visit from node `i` (i.e., there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `graph[i][j]`).

```c++
class Solution {
private:
    // I want to solve this problem using backtrack.
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>> &g, vector<vector<int>> &ans,vector<int> &curr,int node){
        // in ending of each line is n-1
        curr.push_back(node);
        if(node == g.size()-1){
            ans.push_back(curr);
        }else{
            //if this node is not temination point
            // check the next vertex from node/
            
// as it is acyclic, from node 3, it will never back to node 2
            for(int vertex:g[node]){
                dfs(g,ans,curr,vertex);
            }
        }
        
        curr.pop_back();
    }
public:
    // this question is Equivalent to traversal all the edges begin with 0 and end with n-1
    vector<vector<int>> allPathsSourceTarget(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        vector<vector<int>>ans;
        vector<int>curr;
        dfs(graph,ans,curr,0);
        return ans;
    }
};
```

backtrack + dfs
