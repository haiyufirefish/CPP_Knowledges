Given the `head` of a linked list, return *the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return* `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to (**0-indexed**). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. **Note that** `pos` **is not passed as a parameter**.

**Do not modify** the linked list.



```c++
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
        if(!head||!head->next)return nullptr;
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* quick = head;
        while(quick&&quick->next){
            
            slow = slow->next;
            quick = quick->next->next;
            if(slow==quick)break;
            
        }
        if(quick==nullptr||quick->next==nullptr)return nullptr;
     
        slow = head;
        while(slow!=quick){
            slow = slow->next;
            quick = quick->next;
            
        }
        
        return slow;
    }
};
```
