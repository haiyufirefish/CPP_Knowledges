You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return *the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount*. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.



```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
        int n = coins.size();
        //check the corner cases
        if(!n)
            return -1;
        if(!amount)
            return 0;
    //dp[n+1]: dp[n] make amount of n: minimum num of conis  dp[0] = 0 dp[n] = min(dp[n-num] + 1,dp[n])
        // dp[i] means if the amount euqals to i, dp[i] is the best solution
        vector<int>dp(amount+1,amount+1);//biggest solution for each result cannot bigger than the  amount.
        dp[0] = 0;
        for(int &num:coins){
            for(int i = 0;i<=amount;++i){
                if(i-num>=0)
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i-num]+1,dp[i]);
            }
        }
        //complexity: time: O(n*m), space:O(m)
        return dp[amount] > amount?-1:dp[amount];
    }
};
```
