In the video game Fallout 4, the quest **"Road to Freedom"** requires players to reach a metal dial called the **"Freedom Trail Ring"** and use the dial to spell a specific keyword to open the door.

Given a string `ring` that represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string `key` that represents the keyword that needs to be spelled, return *the minimum number of steps to spell all the characters in the keyword*.

Initially, the first character of the ring is aligned at the `"12:00"` direction. You should spell all the characters in `key` one by one by rotating `ring` clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at the `"12:00"` direction and then by pressing the center button.

At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character `key[i]`:

1. You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise by one place, which counts as **one step**. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of `ring`'s characters at the `"12:00"` direction, where this character must equal `key[i]`.
2. If the character `key[i]` has been aligned at the `"12:00"` direction, press the center button to spell, which also counts as **one step**. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage). Otherwise, you have finished all the spelling.

class Solution {
private:
    int dp(string &ring,int i,string &key,int j,unordered_map<char,vector<int>> &indexes,vector<vector<int>> &memo){
        // if(i == ring.size())
        //     return INT_MAX; //impossible
        
        if(j == key.size())
            return 0;
        
        if(memo[i][j] != 0)
            return memo[i][j];
        
        int res = INT_MAX;
        int n = ring.size();
        for(int k : indexes[key[j]]){
            int delta = abs(k-i);
            delta = min(delta,n-delta);            
            int subvalue = dp(ring,k,key,j+1,indexes,memo);
            res = min(res,delta+1+subvalue);
        }
        
        return memo[i][j] = res;
    }
public:
    // The core of this question is to use a hashmap to store the indexes of each char
    int findRotateSteps(string ring, string key) {
        unordered_map<char,vector<int>>indexes;
        int i = 0;
        for(char c:ring){
            indexes[c].push_back(i++);
        }
        int n = ring.size(), m = key.size();
        vector<vector<int>>memo(n,vector<int>(m,0));
        //memo[i][j] means that minimum operations from ring[i...n-1] to key[j...m-1]
        // memp[i][j] = min(1+ rotating + memo[i][j+1],memo[i][j])
        return dp(ring,0,key,0,indexes,memo);
    }
