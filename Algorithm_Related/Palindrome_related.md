### The difference between subsequence and substring
- sample: leetcode
- Both subsequence and substring: leet, code
- Subsequence not substring: let, cde
- neither subsequence nor substring: tlc, dlt

Substring must be sequential and contains **all** elements but subsequence can contain
**any** elements from i to j. (i and j is between 0 and n-1)
